I am currently a Ph.D. candidate and Research & Teaching Assistant at Information Systems, Middle East Technical University ([METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/)). After working on computer vision and machine learning projects during my M.Sc. education, I study 3D model generation with deep generative models for my Ph.D. I have worked as full stack software developer and game programmer at startups. I am the coordinator of METU Deep Learning and Computer Vision Lab (METU DLCV). Game jams!

**Interests**

generative models, computer vision, 3D perception, machine learning, deep learning, CUDA programming, game programming
